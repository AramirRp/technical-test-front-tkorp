## Getting Started

This is the front end part of the technical test made for TKorp, you can find the repo of the first part on my Github. 

To make it work, you'll need to launch the backend server before so the front can be connected. 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
